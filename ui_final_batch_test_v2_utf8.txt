[*] ReasoningEngine: Plan formulated - Clarify the difference between 'closed' and 'open' batches in the BGL3 system and explain when full batch printing is available

--- AGENT RESPONSE ---

The BGL3 system distinguishes between 'closed' (مغلقة) and 'open' (مفتوحة) batches based on their processing status. A 'closed batch' refers to a document batch that has been fully processed and finalized - all guarantees within the batch have been issued, extended, or released, and no further modifications are expected. An 'open batch' is still actively being processed, with guarantees awaiting action or pending decisions. Full batch printing capability becomes available only when a batch is closed, ensuring data integrity and preventing premature document issuance. This design prevents partial or incomplete document sets from being printed, maintaining the system's audit trail integrity.
