To determine if you need to pay extra fees to extend your expired bank guarantee, we would need to go through several steps according to the system's functionality, but unfortunately, I can only find information related to BGL3 (a bank guarantees management web system). Based on what is available in the UI and code snippets provided:

* There isn't a direct snippet showing how fees are calculated or updated for extending expired guarantees.
* We don’t see any specific details about fee structures or calculations within the given UI and code.

However, based on the system’s design and given some of its functions (importing new information, handling statuses, managing supplier data) we can still try to infer:

1. You can find the current status of your guarantee in the GUI under “status”.
2. The system likely checks for expirations and renewal capabilities internally.

Given this limited context and without directly seeing any relevant calculation logic on extending a bank guarantee, I would suggest several potential steps:

- **Check your contract terms**: If there are fees associated with extending an expired bank guarantee, you might first find out by reviewing the initial agreement or contacting whoever provided the original contract.
- **Verify internal settings:** Given we have access to some of the system’s back-end code, it might be feasible that any fee structures or updates would have been encoded in settings configuration files. Yet that’s beyond the immediate analysis here.
