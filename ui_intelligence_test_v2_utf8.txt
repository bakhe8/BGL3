--- AGENT RESPONSE ---

The BGL3 system implements strict lifecycle gates for bank guarantee operations, particularly for release actions. The release.php file contains critical business logic that prevents premature document releases by enforcing a 'ready' status requirement. This gate ensures data integrity by requiring that both supplier and bank selections are finalized before a release letter can be generated. The system follows a disciplined timeline recording approach (Snapshot → Update → Record) to maintain accurate audit trails for UE-04 Release events. The architectural design prioritizes document completeness over speed, reflecting real-world banking compliance requirements where incomplete guarantee documentation cannot be legally released.
