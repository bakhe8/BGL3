--- AGENT RESPONSE ---

The reduce.php API endpoint implements strict validation gates for guarantee reduction operations. Key architectural components include: 1) Positive amount validation (>0), 2) Reduction amount must be LESS than current amount, 3) Status validation (must be 'ready'), 4) Lock prevention (cannot reduce released guarantees), 5) Timeline recording with snapshot capture. The UI shows active reduction buttons and supplier/bank selection interfaces.
