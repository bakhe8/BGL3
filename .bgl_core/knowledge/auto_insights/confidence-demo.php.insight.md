The provided code appears to be a part of a larger system for document issuance. Upon reviewing the `api/reduce.php` file, I noticed that it contains a function named `reduceGuarantee()` which seems to handle the reduction of guarantees. However, there is no input validation or sanitization in place, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities if not properly handled.
