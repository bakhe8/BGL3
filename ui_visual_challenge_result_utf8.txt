--- AGENT RESPONSE ---

In BGL3, 'الدفعات' (batches) are logical groupings of bank guarantee documents processed together. A 'دفعة مغلقة' (closed batch) refers to a batch that has been fully processed and finalized - all guarantees have been issued, validated, and the batch is locked from further modifications. This prevents accidental changes to completed work. A 'دفعة مفتوحة' (open batch) is actively being processed - documents are still being imported, validated, or modified. The system allows full batch printing only for closed batches to ensure data integrity and prevent printing incomplete or inconsistent document sets.
