[*] ReasoningEngine: Plan formulated - Analyze the Arabic query about payment types and printing capabilities within the BGL3 document management context

--- AGENT RESPONSE ---

The user's query asks about the difference between 'closed payment' vs 'open payment' and when full payment printing is available. However, BGL3 is strictly a bank guarantee document issuance system - it manages guarantee letters, extensions, reductions, and releases, NOT actual payments or financial transactions. The system handles documentation lifecycle events (Issued, Extended, Reduced, Released) but has no concept of payment processing, payment types, or payment printing. The UI shows we're currently on the main index page with supplier management and guarantee lifecycle controls visible.
