### No Known Logical Gaps ✅

**Check:** Are there any unresolved logical inconsistencies?

**Status:** ❌ **NO GAPS**

**Phase 2 Audit Results:**
- Zero contradictions found
- All rules codified

- Timeline discipline enforced

**Verdict:** Logic is complete and consistent

---

### Limitations Accepted as Design Boundaries ✅

**Check:** Are all limitations documented and accepted?

**Documented Limitations:**

1. **Silent Learning Blocks** (session load, circular)
   - **Status:** Intentional design
   - **Rationale:** Prevents user disruption
   - **Accepted:** ✅ Yes (Phase 2, Phase 3)

2. **Legacy Data Artifacts** (old records lack modern metadata)
   - **Status:** Expected system evolution
   - **Impact:** None on current workflow
   - **Accepted:** ✅ Yes (Phase 1)

3. **Global Status Badge Lag** (doesn't update dynamically)
   - **Status:** Visual issue only
   - **Impact:** Does not block workflow
   - **Accepted:** ✅ Yes (Phase 1)

**Verdict:** All limitations are known, documented, and accepted
