Based on the provided documentation, it appears that there are no explicit fees mentioned for bank guarantee extension in BGL3.

However, I do not see any mention of fees or charges in the provided **domain_map.yml** file or the **logic_reference.md** document that describe the flow and rules of extending a bank guarantee.

But I can tell you to check the code specifically under `/api/extend.php` API endpoint where it's likely handled.

If there is no information about fees within the BGL3 documentation, it might be assumed that fee calculation would depend on other external systems and integrations with banks or suppliers. 

To get a more accurate answer, reviewing the actual implementation in PHP code of **extend.php** script from `/api/` directory will be helpful.
